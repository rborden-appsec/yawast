### TLS/SSL Information

By default, YAWAST uses SSL Labs to gather information and issues related to TLS. This includes the full list of issues reported by SSL Labs, with some additional information and issues captured. When a scan is performed against a target that SSL Labs would not be able to scan (such as a private IP address), YAWAST will use SSLyze to perform this analysis.

By using SSL Labs and SSLyze, YAWAST is able to capture a significant number of TLS issues; the full list is too long (and updated too often) to display here.

* Certificate details
* Certificate chain
* Supported ciphers
* DNS CAA records
* ...many others

Checks for the following SSL issues are performed (the exact list depends on which integration is used):

* Expired Certificate
* Self-Signed Certificate
* MD5 Signature
* SHA1 Signature
* RC4 Cipher Suites
* CBC Cipher Suites
* Weak (< 128 bit) Cipher Suites
* SWEET32 (via `--tdessessioncount` parameter)
* POODLE
* ROBOT
* Sleeping POODLE
* Untrusted Symantec Root
* TICKETBLEED
* SSLv3 Supported
* TLS 1.0 Supported
* TLS 1.3 Early Data Supported
* TLS 1.3 Not Supported
* Zombie POODLE
* OpenSSL CVE-2014-0224
* OpenSSL CVE-2016-2107
* OpenSSL CVE-2019-1559
* OCSP Staple Missing
* LOGJAM
* Missing AEAD Support
* Insecure Renegotiation
* HEARTBLEED
* Heartbeat Extension Enabled
* GOLDENDOODLE
* Fallback SCSV Missing
* FREAK
* DROWN
* ECDH Parameter Reuse
* DH Parameter Reuse
* DH Common Primes
* Compression Enabled
* ...many others

#### SWEET32

YAWAST is unique among the tools available, in that it provides the only implementation of a test for SWEET32 that does more than check for cipher suites with a 64-bit block size. This allows YAWAST to provide the most accurate assessment of this issue available.

See [here](https://adamcaudill.com/2016/09/15/testing-sweet32-yawast/) for more information.

### DNS Information

* IP Addresses
* IP Owner/Network (via [api.iptoasn.com](https://api.iptoasn.com/))
* TXT Records
* MX Records
* NS Records
* CAA Records (with CNAME chasing)
* Common Subdomains (2,354 subdomains) - optional, via `--subdomains`
* SRV Records - optional, via `--srv`

In addition to these tests, certain basic information is also displayed, such as IPs (and the PTR record for each IP), HTTP HEAD request, and others.
