Today we are pleased to announce the immediate release of YAWAST v0.9.0 - this is a regular monthly release, as part of our normal beginning of the month release cadence. This is a feature and bug-fix release, addressing an uncommon bug, and adding a few new features.

The most important new feature is the addition of the `--header='name=value'` parameter, which allows you to specify a header (such as a bearer token) that will be include in each request. This allows you to perform authenticated scans of applications that don't use session cookies.
